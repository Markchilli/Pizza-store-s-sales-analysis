## About my Pizza store's sales analysis project
In this project, I proceed an analysis on sales records of a Pizza Brand. With my knowledge of this industry and the dataset, I will focus on the most recent year (2022) to gain insights about the sales performance . I will use both SQL and Python for this project because from my experience, sometimes python can help with dataser overview, data cleaning and data visualizations... 
Specifically, this is my analytical process:\
Start point: Make a list of business requirements related to sales performance for later analysis\
-> Collect necessary data. Take an overview and clean the datasets using Python\
-> Analyze the cleaned dataset in both SQL in Python to deal with the list of business requirements made above\
-> Use Tableau to create a dashboard and a story for showing valueable insights from the analytical process

### In SQL
I will try to answer 4 main problems: 
  1. How is the revenue going over time and it's monthly growth rate showing? In 2022, what is the most profitable days, month and period?
  2. In 12 months in 2022, what channel, order type and province create the most revenue ?
  3. Find top 100 valueable customers to award them with gifts or promotion activities
  4. Calculate the quaterly retention rate in 2022
### In Python
I will use python for some reasons:
  1. Take an overview and clean the dataset
  2. Proceed analysis to answer problems listed above (Add some personal analysis)
  3. Predict the customers who are going to churn (I'm in trouble - not completed this yet)
  4. Show visualization to understand better the analytic results before creating dashboard and slides.
### In Tableau
I will show my analytical results to stakeholders in 2 things:
  1. A dashboard to summarise sales of 2022
  2. A story-telling slides to present the present trends, anomalies, valuable insights from recent sales performance...
